Window Chord is a collection of programs for manipulating windows
under X11.  Each window operation should be bound to a different key
combination, or "chord," like ~Ctrl-Alt-Shift-W~ for bringing up a web
browser, or ~Ctrl-Alt-Shift-2~ for making the selected window occupy
the right half of the screen.  That way, no matter what window system
you're using, you have consistent, quick, mouse-free control over
every window that just gets out of the way.

Some of the programs depend on Chibi Scheme, an excellent
implementation of Scheme written by Alex Shinn, as well as ~wmctrl~
and ~xdotool~.
